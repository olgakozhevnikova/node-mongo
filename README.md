# Node and MongoDB exercise

### This exercise is a part of the course: Server-side Development with NodeJS, Express and MongoDB

This exercise is devided into several parts.

**In the 1st part** I installed the Node MongoDb driver module and configured Node application to communicate with the MongoDB server.

**In the 2nd part** I implemented a Node module (operations.js), that contains common MongoDB operations, such as insert, find, update and delete a document.

**In the 3rd part** I used promises to eliminate callback hell problem, that was there before. Callback hell problem is related to heavily nested code. And promises help to solve this problem.
